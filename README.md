# Simulation of Synchronous-Bounded-Buffer
Produce Consumer problem solved with Synchronous Bounded Buffer

This code doesn't implement any Producer/Consumer IPC mechanism purposefully. Becase the intent of this program is to solve Producer - Consumer synchronous communication problem
with Bounded buffer using semaphore and mutex.
