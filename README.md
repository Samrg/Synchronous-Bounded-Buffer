# Simulation of Synchronous-Bounded-Buffer
Produce Consumer problem solved with Synchronous Bounded Buffer

This code doesn't implement any Producer/Consumer IPC mechanism purposefully. Becase the intent of this program is synchronise the Bounded buffer to be used in Producer-Consumer problem without deadlock or race condition.
So main focus is on how Bounded buffer can be synchronised.

The classical Producer-Consumer problem
